# cpp-condition

In the following program, we can view some examples of conditions, like AND / OR and also the boolean condition.

// != not equal
// == equal
// <= less than
// >= greater than

(x == 1 && y >= 2) AND condition. Both conditions must be met, so the result will be true.
(x == 1 || y >= 2) OR condition. One of the statements needs to be true, so the result will be true.
